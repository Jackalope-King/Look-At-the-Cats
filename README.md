### This is my cat Han. He is about 5 years old now and is a perfect being. Big and fluffy, and very chill. Often desrcibed as a pillowpet.

### This is my cat Cupcake. She's like 2 or 3 years olf now and is evil. Small vicious and loving. Often described as a demon. 
#### Extra tidbit, we actually saved her a kitten we found dying in our garage and then ended up keeping her in the family.
